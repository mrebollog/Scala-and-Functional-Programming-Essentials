This repository mirrors the structure of the Udemy course I followed.
Inside `src/main/scala`:

- **`lectures/`** contains the exercises that were provided in the lectures that included exercises.  
- **`exercises/`** contains additional, more general exercises that were also introduced throughout the lectures but placed separately by the instructor.
